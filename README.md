# PyElevator_HighRiseControl
This Python-based elevator application is designed for efficient control and management of elevators in high-rise buildings. Leveraging Python's simplicity and versatility, this project provides a comprehensive solution for elevator scheduling, floor prioritization, and real-time monitoring.

**Key Features:**
Smart Elevator Scheduling: Optimize elevator movement to reduce waiting times and energy consumption.
Floor Prioritization: Intelligently handle elevator requests based on user destinations and building traffic.
Real-Time Monitoring: Track elevator status, usage patterns, and performance metrics for proactive maintenance.

**Technologies Used:**
Python
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
Data Structures for efficient algorithm implementation

**How to Use:**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the application using Python.
Simulate elevator requests and observe the optimized scheduling in action.
Contributions:
Contributions and enhancements are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

**Note:**
This project is an educational initiative to explore efficient elevator control algorithms and is not intended for production use in real-world applications.
